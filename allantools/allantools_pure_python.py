Implemented functions:
adev() and adev_phase()     Allan deviation
oadev() and oadev_phase()   Overlapping Allan deviation
mdev() and mdev_phase()     Modified Allan deviation
tdev() and tdev_phase()     Time deviation ( modified variance scaled by (t^2/3) )
hdev() and hdev_phase()     Hadamard deviation
ohdev() and ohdev_phase()   Overlapping Hadamard deviation
totdev() and totdev_phase() Total deviation
mtie() and mtie_phase()     Maximum Time Interval Error
tierms() and tierms_phase() Time Interval Error RMS

to do:
Modified Total
The modified total variance, MTOT, is total version of the modified Allan variance.
It is defined for phase data as:
                         1           N-3m+1  1  N+3m-1
Mod s^2 total(t) = ----------------- sum     -- sum      [0zi*(m)]^2
                    2m^2t0^2(N-3m+1) n=1     6m i=n-3m
where the 0zi*(m) terms are the phase averages from a triply-extended
sequence created by uninverted even reflection at each end,
and the prefix 0 denotes that the linear trend has been removed.

Time Total (modified total variance scaled by (t^2/3) )
Hadamard Total
